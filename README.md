<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I created an Active Directory (AD) home lab environment using Oracle VirtualBox to deepen my understanding of AD and Windows networking. I built a robust infrastructure by setting up a domain, configuring user accounts, and implementing group policies to enforce security settings and standardize user environments. Additionally, I configured a DHCP server for dynamic IP address assignment and established static IP addresses, subnet masks, and a default gateway for the domain host, optimizing overall network management. To streamline the user account creation process, I utilized PowerShell to automate the generation of over 1,000 user accounts from a text file. This project significantly enhanced my practical skills in user identity management and secure networking practices, effectively preparing me for real-world IT challenges.
